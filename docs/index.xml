RTMP is what all the major live streaming services use, so if you&amp;rsquo;re currently using one of those it&amp;rsquo;s likely that you can point your existing software at your Owncast instance instead.
However, we haven&amp;rsquo;t tested with everything. So if you&amp;rsquo;re using something specific we&amp;rsquo;d love to hear what software you&amp;rsquo;re using and the results.</description></item><item><title>Building 3rd Party Integrations</title><link>http://owncast.online/docs/integrations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://owncast.online/docs/integrations/</guid><description>Building addons, bots, overlays and more on top of Owncast # You&amp;rsquo;re one of the first people to try out our 3rd party APIs, how exciting!
