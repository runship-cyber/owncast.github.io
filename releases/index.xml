The biggest being the ability to use hardware accelerated video codecs and free up your CPU if you&amp;rsquo;re running on dedicated hardware. This is great for people who are hosting from home, even on things like a Raspberry Pi. Other additions people have asked for such as being able to upload your logo directly from the admin, hiding chat, custom CSS, being able to manually select a video stream quality from the player and more are included in this update.</description></item><item><title>Owncast v0.0.6</title><link>/releases/owncast-0.0.6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/releases/owncast-0.0.6/</guid><description>0.0.6 has quite a few changes that impact you, so please take a moment to read about these changes in their entirety.
